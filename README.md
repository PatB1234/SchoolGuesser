This is a GeoGuesser clone made custom for my school. Students and Staff can guess the location of a photo, which will be displayed inside our school. The admin can use a special code to submit the answer in coordinate form. Users must click on a map to guess where they think it is. On the next rotation, the system will choose the winner based on who was closest to the origin using the Haversine formula.
